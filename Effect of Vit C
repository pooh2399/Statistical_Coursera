### Overview
The aim of this analysis is to analyze toothgrowth by comparing the growth of the teeth with respect to supplement and dose.

### Loading the ToothGrowth data 
```{r results='hide'}
library(datasets)
data(ToothGrowth)
str(ToothGrowth)
head(ToothGrowth)
summary(ToothGrowth)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
tt = ToothGrowth
levels(tt$supp) <- c("Orange Juice", "Ascorbic Acid")
ggplot(tt, aes(x=factor(dose), y=len)) + 
  facet_grid(.~supp) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = supp), show_guide = FALSE) +
  labs(title="tooth length by dosage for each type of supplement", 
    x="Dose (mg/day)",
    y="Tooth Length")
```

### Basic summary of the data
According the plot, by increasing the dosage there is an increase in teeth growth.
At dosage 0.5 to 1.0 mg , Orange juice is more effective than ascorbic acid for tooth growth.
At 2mg per day dosage , both orange and ascorbic as similar in effectiveness.

### confidence intervals & hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supplement and dose
#### Hypothesis #1
Orange juice & ascorbic acid deliver the same tooth growth across the data set.
```{r}
hypo1<-tt.test(len ~ supp, data = tt)
hypo1$conf.int
hypo1$p.value
```
The confidence intervals includes 0 and the p-value is greater than the 
threshold of 0.05.  The null hypothesis cannot be rejected.

#### Hypothesis #2
For the dosage of 0.5 mg per day, the two supplements deliver the similar teeth growth.
```{r}
hypo2<-tt.test(len ~ supp, data = subset(tt, dose == 0.5))
hypo2$conf.int
hypo2$p.value
```
The confidence interval does not include 0 and the p-value is below the 0.05 
threshold. The null hypothesis can be rejected. The alternative hypothesis 
that 0.5 mg/day dosage of orange juice delivers more tooth growth than ascorbic 
acid is accepted.

#### Hypothesis #3
For the dosage of 1 mg per day, the two supplements provide the same tooth growth
```{r}
hypo3<-tt.test(len ~ supp, data = subset(tt, dose == 1))
hypo3$conf.int
hypo3$p.value
```
The confidence interval does not include 0 and the p-value is smaller than the 
0.05 threshold therefore the null thoery can be removed where as the thoery 
that 1 mg per day dosage of orange juice provides more tooth growth than ascorbic 
acid is accepted.

#### Hypothesis #4
For the dosage of 2 mg/day, the two supplements provide the same tooth growth
```{r}
hypo4<-tt.test(len ~ supp, data = subset(tt, dose == 2))
hypo4$conf.int
hypo4$p.value
```
As 0 is present and the p-value is greater than 0.05 , hence the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.


### Conclusions & assumptions
At 0.5 - 1.0 dosage , orange juice is the better option.
At 2 mg per day dosage , Either of two option can be used as they have same effectiveness.
Due to lack of data , we cannot acertain that orange juice is better than ascorbic acid.
