## Overview
Aim of this analysis is to compare the exponential distribution to the CLT theorem.
In this analysis , the lamda value will be set to 2.0 for all cases.
An average of 40 exp over 1000 simulations wil be done

## Simulations
Setting values to lambda, exp, and seed.
```{r}
ECHO=TRUE
set.seed(1337)
l = 0.2
exp = 40
```

Run Simulations with variables
```{r}
mean_simu = NULL
for (i in 1 : 1000) mean_simu = c(mean_simu, mean(rexp(exp, l)))
```


## Sample Mean versus Theoretical Mean
#### Sample Mean
Calculating the mean.
```{r}
mean(mean_simu)
```

#### Theoretical Mean
The theoretical mean of an exponential distribution is l raised to the power -1.
```{r}
l^-1
```

#### Comparison
Sample mean and exp distribution mean only have samll difference
```{r}
abs(mean(mean_simu)-l^-1)
```


## Sample Variance Vs Theoretical Variance
#### Sample Variance
Calculating the variance from the simulation means will give the sample
variance.
```{r}
var(mean_simu)
```

#### Theoretical Variance
The theoretical variance of an exponential distribution is 
(l * sqrt(n))^-2.
```{r}
(l * sqrt(exp))^-2
```

#### Comparison
Similar to their means , both variance only have small diferences between then
```{r}
abs(var(mean_simu)-(l * sqrt(exp))^-2)
```


## Distribution
This is a density histogram of the 1000 simulations. There is an overlay with a 
normal distribution that has a mean of l^-1 and standard deviation of 
(l*sqrt(n))^-1, the theoretical normal distribution for the simulations.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data.frame(y=mean_simu), aes(x=y)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), binwidth=0.2, fill="#0072B2", 
                 color="black") +
  stat_function(fun=dnorm, arg=list(mean=l^-1, 
                                    sd=(l*sqrt(exp))^-1), 
                size=2) +
  labs(title="Plot of the Simulations", x="Simulation Mean")
```
